# **My Journey as a Telkom System Development Learner**

This learnership has been one of the most exciting steps in my tech journey. At Telkom, I’ve learned how real systems are built, tested, and supported — while growing my skills in web development, databases, and problem-solving.

## 🚀 What I Learned

* HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
* How systems are analysed, designed, and documented
* Databases and SQL basics
* Technical support and troubleshooting
* Teamwork, communication, and professionalism

## 🛠 Highlights

* Built simple web pages and mini-projects
* Created system diagrams and documentation
* Solved real ICT problems
* Worked in groups and presented work confidently

## 🎯 Looking Ahead

I’m excited to keep building my skills, create more projects, and grow into a skilled front-end or full-stack developer.
